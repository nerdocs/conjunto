    Parameters:

        instance: The model instance that the action is performed on
        action: The code name for the action being performed. This can be one of the
                names listed below or a custom action defined through the
                register_log_actions hook.
        user (optional): the user initiating the action. For actions logged within
                an admin view, this defaults to the logged-in user.
        uuid (optional): log entries given the same UUID indicates that they occurred
                as part of the same user action (for example a page being immediately
                published on creation).
        title: The string representation, of the instance being logged. By default,
                Conjunto will attempt to use the instanceâ€™s str representation or

        data (optional): a dictionary of additional JSON-serialisable data to store
                against the log entry
